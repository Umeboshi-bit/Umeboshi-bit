# Hi, I'm Shami 👋

Product Manager based in **Japan**, building domain-specific AI BPO products.

I ship products daily with Claude Code and work closely with engineers to turn ideas into production-ready software. My background is in product — but I read code, write code, and care deeply about engineering culture.

## What I'm building

I'm working on **AI-powered BPO solutions** — products that combine LLMs with domain expertise to automate complex business processes. Think AI agents that actually replace manual workflows, not just chatbots.

## I'm looking for engineers

I'm starting a **tech staffing company connecting Pakistani engineers with opportunities in Japan.**

Japan's tech industry has a massive talent shortage, and Pakistan has some of the sharpest engineers in the world. I want to bridge that gap.

**If you're a software engineer based in Pakistan and curious about working in Japan**, I'd love to talk. No commitments — just a conversation to see if there's a fit.

What I'm looking for:
- 2-3 years of hands-on development experience
- Strong fundamentals in TypeScript, Python, or similar
- Interest in working with Japanese companies (remote or relocation)
- Builders who ship, not just coders who commit

## Tech I work with

`TypeScript` `Next.js` `Python` `Claude API` `LLMs` `Agentic AI`

## Let's connect
